[CmdletBinding()]
param()

try {
    # Start-Transcript -Path "C:\Logs\Check-PasswordPolicy_$(Get-Date -Format 'yyyyMMdd_HHmmss').log" -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue

    Write-Host "Checking local password policy..."

    # You can also leverage 'net accounts' for quick retrieval:
    $netAccounts = net accounts
    Write-Host "===== 'net accounts' Output ====="
    Write-Host $netAccounts

    # Alternatively, gather from registry or WMI:
    $minPasswordLength = (Get-ItemProperty "HKLM:\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\Netlogon\Parameters" -Name "MinimumPasswordLength" -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue).MinimumPasswordLength
    if ($minPasswordLength) {
        Write-Host "Minimum Password Length: $minPasswordLength"
    } else {
        Write-Host "Minimum Password Length setting not found or not configured in registry."
    }

    # More checks can be added here (e.g., Maximum Password Age, Password Complexity, etc.)

} catch {
    Write-Error "An error occurred while checking password policy: $_"
} finally {
    # Stop-Transcript -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
